      <h1 class="section-head">Premise</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-5">For the final project in my User Interface Design II course, I was tasked with designing an informational website or application intended to teach a user something new. I was required to incorporate 20 interface design concepts/terms to enhance the effectiveness of the design as a learning platform. I chose to teach the user how to record guitars into a computer in the highest quality possible for home recording. This is a topic that I know well through experience with home studio recording and had a manageable amount of complexity given the scope of the class. I chose to execute the interface as a desktop website because the activity I’m teaching takes place on a desktop or laptop computer, and I feel very comfortable designing for the web.</p>

      <h1 class="section-head">Process </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-5">To design an interface that incorporates interface design concepts, you must have a solid understanding of the concepts first. The early weeks of this course were spent learning and solidifying a deep understanding of user interface design concepts. When assigned this final project, I submitted a proposal to demonstrate my knowledge of the concepts and discuss my intentions for the design of this website. With my proposal approved, I began by sketching and wireframing the intended user flow and basic layout of elements. From there, I iterated on digital prototypes, starting with a simple wireframe then each version progressed in fidelity and visual design. With iteration and refinement, I was able to make this interface a more effective platform for teaching user’s how to record guitars. Given the scope and time frame of the course, I only created the full course for one of the four potential lessons in order to create the most effective learning interface I could.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-5 white">Jakob’s Law states that users prefer to use sites similar to others they commonly use because they spend most of their time on other sites. My design abides by Jakob’s Law by following common web conventions. These conventions are things like a site ID or logo that links to the home page, a persistent navigation that scrolls with you, and using standard spacing on the navigation links on the right side of the navbar. I utilized common features like these to make my website function like sites the users are accustomed to.</p>

          <h1 class="section-head white">Schema and Prior Knowledge </h1>
          <p class="paragraph-5 white">When designing an interface, abiding by Jakob’s Law and the following web/interface conventions help to match the user’s schema or mental structure of concepts. In the context of this project, an important part of the user’s schema is a set of expectations from websites designed to teach them something. To help understand a potential user’s prior knowledge, I researched a variety of educational websites. I found inspiration from both formal learning systems, like those made by textbook manufacturers, and from casual online learning platforms like wikiHow. Some common features that I found and integrated into my site include the title of the step or section at the top, a preview or name of the next section at the end of the page, buttons at the bottom of the page to navigate to the next or previous step, and a progress bar that updates with each completed step.  <br><br>Making design decisions based on a potential user’s prior knowledge is critical to ensure the site is informative but not overwhelming. Because this website is teaching a user about recording guitar, it could make assumptions about their prior knowledge in the topics of music and audio equipment alongside their schema for how learning systems should function. I assumed my users have a solid understanding of guitar and guitar gear, and at least a basic understanding of recording equipment, techniques, software, and terminology. Presenting the correct amount of information for a key user’s prior knowledge without alienating a user with less knowledge is a challenge. In the first iteration of step 1, I presented the user with four solid paragraphs of text because I felt it was all vital information for the process of recording guitar. I quickly realized it was an overwhelming amount of information and decided to only present the high-level information so more knowledgeable user’s can skim quickly without being overwhelmed with extraneous material. For users who need a little bit more help with the basics, each column has a “read more” button that reveals additional helpful details. Understanding my user’s schema and prior knowledge was a vital step in presenting the right amount of information on this site. <br></p>

      <h1 class="section-head white sides">Memory </h1>
      <p class="paragraph-5 white space"><strong>Working memory</strong> or short-term memory has a limited capacity and is the information that we are consciously thinking about. As the user is learning the material, the information will be in their working memory. In order for the user to remember and be able to recall the information, it must be effectively processed into long-term memory. Long-term memory has unlimited capacity and is subconscious, so the user is not actively thinking about this information. On this website, I made design decisions that help the user effectively process the material necessary to record guitar into their long-term memory so that they can recall this information at a later time. One of these decisions includes providing the right amount of information and context based on the user’s prior knowledge. Another was to create effective chunking by applying the Law of Proximity, to make the material more manageable for the user. One more decision was to follow the guidelines of cognitive load theory by managing intrinsic cognitive load, enhancing germane cognitive load, and removing extraneous cognitive load.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-5 white">Once the user has clicked “Get Started” on the site’s landing page, they will be asked to choose one of the multiple lessons based on the equipment the user has access to and their need for the specific situation. The method that will yield the best result (recording an amplifier with a microphone) is highlighted with a bright green border and labeled as the “preferred method.” However, the user can select whichever path suits them the best. This will make it easier to remember that this path is the ideal method because of the <strong>Von Restorff Effect</strong>, which states that when multiple items are similar, the one that is the most different is the most likely to be remembered. While lessons 1,3, and 4 are visually consistent, lesson 2 has a bright green border, making it clearly the most different option.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-5 white">Once the user is in a selected lesson, they will be presented with the instructions in sequential steps. Because <strong>Miller’s Law</strong> states that people can only remember seven plus or minus two items, I limited the learning process of lesson 2 (the lesson I went into detail with) to six steps to ensure that users can remember each step and process them effectively. To help the user prepare for the lesson, I presented the title of each step before the user starts the lesson.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-5 white"><strong>Tesler’s Law</strong> states that in any application, there is an inherent amount of complexity that cannot be removed or hidden. Essentially, this is referring to intrinsic cognitive load, the information necessary for the task at hand. In my website, the intrinsic cognitive load is the information necessary to learn how to record a guitar. Because this information cannot be avoided, it was critical that I made design decisions to manage this intrinsic cognitive load. I had to ensure that most of the material that this site presents is necessary and is managed properly to aid the user’s processing of information. Through iteration, I was able to remove some of the complexity of recording guitars, but per Tesler’s Law, a certain amount of complexity remains, and I had to use design techniques to deal with it.</p>

          <p class="paragraph-5 white">One method I utilized to deal with intrinsic cognitive load was chunking<strong>,</strong> which is grouping information into smaller, more manageable units so that it is easier to remember the information. By giving each step its own page, I broke the information into smaller units. Within each page, I created effective chunking by applying the Law of Proximity, which states that items grouped more closely to each other and farther from other items are perceived as a group. I placed similar information, such as text and the corresponding picture, closer together to let the user know that these items are grouped, allowing them to process the information in smaller units. Allowing the user to process material in these smaller units helps to manage the inherent complexity of intrinsic cognitive load.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-5 white space">This website includes both software and hardware images to demonstrate the concepts being explained in the text. Relevant images that help to explain concepts are an example of germane cognitive load,<strong> </strong>which is information that is not necessary but is helpful to learning. The idea of using images of software and hardware alongside text explaining the concepts is validated by the <strong>Multimedia Principle, </strong>which states that people learn better with words and pictures than with words alone. Because of this, I used a number of relevant images alongside text to help the user understand the text better. These images are considered germane because the user receives all the necessary information with text alone, but the images are helpful in processing material effectively.</p>
      <h1 class="section-head white sides">Coherence Principle and Extraneous Cognitive Load</h1>
      <p class="paragraph-5 white space">According to the Coherence Principle, people learn better when extraneous material is removed. This extraneous material is considered extraneous cognitive load, which is information that is not necessary or relevant to the task at hand. Because of this, I avoided using material that would not help the user learn how to record guitars, such as flashy visuals that have nothing to do with guitars or audio recording. <br></p>

          <h1 class="section-head white">Signaling Principle and Visual Cues</h1>
          <p class="paragraph-5 white">When I included relevant images on the site, it was necessary to point out the important parts of the images because audio systems have a lot of features that may not be relevant to the specific task being explained. Because of this, I applied the signaling principle, which states that people learn better when cues that highlight the organization of essential material are used. I did so by using visual cues such as arrows, highlighting elements, or graying out elements that are not as important. I also applied the signaling principle by highlighting important words with the same color as the word in the associated graphic. The clearest usage of visual cues in this site is the arrows and boxes that point out the important elements in the images of each step. These design choices that highlight the organization of important information allowed me to utilize the signaling principle to make the site more friendly for skimming.</p>

Doing this is more effective for learning than placing cues to the side or using letters on the images with a key below to match to the image. This is because the Spatial Contiguity Principle states that people learn better when corresponding words and images are presented near each other.</p>

As stated by the Zeigarnik Effect, incomplete tasks are more easily remembered than completed tasks. Because of this, the progress bar will remind the user that their learning is incomplete, meaning users will likely remember to return to the website to continue learning if they have to leave at any time and serve to motivate the user to continue.</p>

      <p class="paragraph-5">Designing an interface for learning was a new and exciting challenge for me. I was able to deepen my understanding of interface design terminology and learn how to apply them in context. With a foundation of knowledge on how users learn and interact with digital systems, I have been able to design an effective informational website in the absence of user testing. User testing is always ideal in an interaction design process. However, when it cannot be done, understanding the relevant concepts and human behaviors can empower a design to still create an effective user interface. Going forward, the foundation I built through this project will help to make the pre-user testing iterations of my designs more effective and allow me to more efficiently refine based on user feedback.</p><img src="images/Right-Track-Rotato-Snapshot-Edited.png" width="802" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 90vw, 550px" srcset="images/Right-Track-Rotato-Snapshot-Edited-p-500.png 500w, images/Right-Track-Rotato-Snapshot-Edited-p-800.png 800w, images/Right-Track-Rotato-Snapshot-Edited-p-1080.png 1080w, images/Right-Track-Rotato-Snapshot-Edited.png 1440w" alt="" class="image-21">
